|    mmm check out all that ugly hardcoded formatting. we need
|    all these &nbsp;s in order to get the lists to appear as dashed,
|    which sure is a hack, but it turns out great in my opinion.
|   
|    i'm kinda a minimalist.
|   
|    also if you're reading this than you're probably someone
|    who admires me somewhat...
|    ...or at least this readme you find intriguing.
|   
|    i appreciate that. and i just want to say that i love you too

|    i gotta say, classes so far are either easy, or are related to calculus.
|    and the cs classes most of the time feel like the instructor doesnt actually
|    do real work in the industry but i have a pretty warped perspective on things.

&nbsp;- arch linux user<br/>
<!--
|    i originally grabbed Ubuntu on my old two core 8gb ram laptop because windows
|    was so bad at existing and running itself without things going haywire.
|    one time, it was so bad that a windows update set the thing into a BSOD loop.
|
|    linux solved all that, but it also made it harder to do creative things like
|    video editing and music making. though at the time i didnt do either of those,
|    i just wanted to use google docs. later on i found fusion and you know the story.
|    
|    but sheesh that laptop's harddrive got so abused though. i installed windows
|    and linux DOZENS of times through its lifename. even tried macos a couple of
|    times via hackintosh stuff. all of that was so much fun. it sucks that i cant
|    try hackintosh on my new desktop, the RTX 3090 would be such a beast on that.

<!-- &nbsp;- software developer; mostly web tech with typescript<br/> -->
<!--
|    listing every language you know is fucking stupid and pretty useless, but
|    since someone is going to want to know, i also know lua, python, java, and c++
|
|    you could also say i "know" c/rust/zig/c#/asm/mcfunction/brainfuck but i dont
|    use these as much as saying that i know them would imply, so it's kinda misleading
|    even java and c++ i cant truly say i KNOW because i havent really made anything
|    significant with them.
|
|    though i'd love to do some lower level programming with zig or rust soon.
|    maybe.

&nbsp;- video artist with blender and blackmagic fusion<br/> <!--
|    for the love of god please do not ever install fusion yourself. its
|    a bad addiction for me. it runs so slow and if i had the time i would
|    write an alternative that fit my usecases of it and could have a viewport
|    that rendered in realtime.

&nbsp;- songwriter and music producer<br/>
<!-- 
|    one thing i dont like about the music production world is they really really
|    love the mac. and windows. it makes sense to support those two operating systems
|    but im still a little salty that even under wine i cant get music stuff to "just
|    work" on linux. so i use windows for this. maybe when im rich and famous ill
|    actually buy into it and get a mac and iphone and all their products.
